# T-series

Time series models are very useful models when you have serially correlated data. Most of business houses work on time series
data to analyze sales number for the next year, website traffic, competition position and much more. Arima and Holt winters are
some famous time series methods for short term and long term forecast. I have used here datasets to forecast tractor sales(ARIMA
model) and annual barley production(Holt winters model).
